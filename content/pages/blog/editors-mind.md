## SOCIAL MEDIA PHOBIA

This is my first post of the blog in this website , today i will tell how did i overcame Social media Phobia.

Social Media and eventually internet has clutched us so hard that we can't escape easily and if we do  escape then we feel like too much at a time

 or nothing at all .

A week before i was so angry that i threw my smartphone in the wall front of me . When i picked it up , the screen guard just was thrown away and

the TP(Display ) was severly damaged and few sensors too, back glass was also broken but Camera was Safe, both one .

But My father didn't put a hand on me ,  of course he scolded . I sent my phone in service center for repair , it was under warranty. Bill went to 6200rs +GST . 

It will be delivered to me in 4 days as said by service center.  But in those 4 days i learnt a lot .

1.   I felt that Day became longer .

2.   I started seeing Up in the sky, which i felt that i didn't do from many months due to daily online classes in COVID ERA.

3.  Next Day i woke up early than usual.

4.  I lost contact with my social media which made me feel less tensed and less heavy at heart.

5.  I learned to feel nature way more than earlier.

6.  I focussed more on my study . i studied way ahead than class while preparing for lecture.

7.  I started doing Exercises and Pushups-situps to regain my  earlier heavily built body .

After MY Phone arrived , i still follow these practises and learnt to be less dependent on internet and social media.
