## Internet Phobia

This is my first post of the blog , today i will tell how did i overcame Internet Phobia.

Social Media and eventually internet has clutched us so hard that we can't escape easily and if we do  escape then we feel 

like too much at a time or nothing at all .

A week before i was so angry that i threw my smartphone in the wall front of me . When i picked it up , the screen guard just was thrown away and 

the TP(Display ) was severly damaged and few sensors too, back glass was also broken but Camera was Safe, both one .
